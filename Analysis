Conclusions about the Data

1. With the treatment of capomulin, the cancer in mouse m601 was able to be treated. Based on the data, it showed that
capomulin can be an effective cancer treatment. Of the four regimens of treatment that I analyzed, capomulin and ramicane had
mice with the smallest tumor volumes proving their effectiveness.

2. Based on the scatter plot and looking at our r-value, there is a correlation between average tumor volume and mouse weight. 
With mice of a larger size, the average tumor volume is larger. With a correlation value of .84, there is strong correlation, 
showing a relationship between average tumor volume and mouse weight. Based on the data, we can see that mice of a larger size have
larger tumors on average based on volume.
