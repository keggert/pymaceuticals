Conclusions about the Data

1. With the treatment of capomulin, the average tumor volume decreased. Based on the data, it showed that capomulin can be an 
effective cancer treatment. Of the four regimens of treatment that I analyzed, capomulin and ramicane had mice with the 
smallest tumor volumes, proving their effectiveness. Capomulin was able to decrease the average tumor volume of the mice that
were treated.

2. Based on the scatter plot and looking at our r-value, there is a correlation between average tumor volume and mouse weight. 
With mice of a larger size, the average tumor volume is larger. With a correlation value of .84, there is strong correlation, 
showing a relationship between average tumor volume and mouse weight. Based on the data, we can see that mice of a larger size 
have larger tumors on average based on volume.

3. Based on the bar plots, it seems that the drug treatments that had a higher number of mice were more effective. Capomulin
and Ramicane were two of the more effective treatments and they were used to treat the highest number of mice.
